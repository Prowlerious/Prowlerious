Greetings on my GitHub corner.

I'm frontend developer with more than 13 years practice in commercial software developing (flash/HTML5 game developer, Angular software developer and PM experience).
It's my sandbox for learning of new languages and technologies, also for pet projects.

You're welcome here!
